## PR Summary

This pull request makes minor changes to the package.json file to test and validate the complete automated documentation workflow. It includes a version bump and keyword additions related to the project's functionality.

### Key Achievements
- ‚úÖ Version bump to 1.1.0
- ‚úÖ Addition of relevant keywords to improve package discoverability
- ‚úÖ Successful trigger of the automated documentation workflow

## Changes Overview

### Files Modified
| File | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `package.json` | **MODIFIED** | Updated version and keywords |

### Functionality Added
1. **Version Bump** - Updated package version to 1.1.0
2. **Enhanced Discoverability** - Added keywords for better package indexing

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

#### Package Version Update
The version was bumped from a previous version to 1.1.0, following semantic versioning principles.

#### Keyword Additions
Six descriptive keywords were added to the package.json file:
```json
"keywords": [
  "claude",
  "github-actions", 
  "documentation",
  "automation",
  "ai",
  "workflow-testing"
]
```

These keywords accurately reflect the purpose of the repository, which is to test Claude's automated documentation capabilities with GitHub Actions.

### Integration Points

The package.json modifications serve as a trigger for the automated documentation workflow, ensuring that:
1. The PR merge event is properly detected
2. The documentation issue is automatically created
3. Claude properly analyzes and documents the changes
4. A documentation PR is automatically created

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
