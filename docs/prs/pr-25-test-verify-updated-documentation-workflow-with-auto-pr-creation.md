# PR #25: Test: Verify updated documentation workflow with auto PR creation

## PR Summary
This PR was created to test and verify the updated documentation workflow with automatic PR creation capability. It implements a minimal change (adding an HTML comment to README.md) designed to trigger the documentation workflow without significant code impact.

## Changes Overview
- **Files Modified**:
  - `README.md`: Added an HTML comment to test the documentation workflow

## Technical Details
The implementation was straightforward:
- Added an HTML comment to README.md: `<!-- Testing updated workflow with auto PR creation - 2025-08-14 -->`
- This comment serves as a timestamp and marker for the test
- The change was intentionally minimal to focus on testing the workflow rather than implementing actual features

## Testing
- No specific tests were required for this change as it was non-functional
- The PR itself served as a test case for the automated documentation workflow
- Success criteria was based on whether the workflow correctly:
  1. Detected the PR merge
  2. Created an issue requesting documentation
  3. Generated appropriate documentation
  4. Automatically created a new PR with the documentation
