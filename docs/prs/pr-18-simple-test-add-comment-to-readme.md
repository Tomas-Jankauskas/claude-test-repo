# PR #18: Simple test: Add comment to README

## PR Summary
This Pull Request adds a simple HTML comment to the README.md file. The change serves as a minimal test case for the automated documentation generation workflow in the Claude Code Action test repository.

## Changes Overview
- Added an HTML comment to README.md: `<!-- Simple test change for documentation generation - 2025-08-14 -->`
- This was the only change made in this PR

## Technical Details
The implementation approach was straightforward:
- A single HTML comment was added to line 3 of README.md
- The comment is formatted as: `<!-- Simple test change for documentation generation - 2025-08-14 -->`
- The comment is placed just before the repository description text
- This change doesn't affect the rendered Markdown output in GitHub's UI

## Testing
No specific tests were added or modified for this change as it:
- Doesn't affect any functionality
- Is purely a documentation comment not visible in rendered Markdown
- Was intended as a minimal test case for the documentation generation workflow

## Impact Analysis
This change has:
- No breaking changes
- No performance implications
- No compatibility concerns
- No functional impact on the repository

The primary purpose was to trigger the automated documentation workflow with minimal cost:
1. pr-autodoc.yml workflow
2. Documentation request issue creation (#19)
3. Claude Code Action documentation generation

## Future Considerations
- This PR serves as a baseline test case for automated documentation
- Future PRs will test more complex changes and documentation generation
- The automated documentation workflow functions as expected with this minimal change
- The estimated cost for this documentation generation was approximately $0.05-0.15, making it an efficient test case
